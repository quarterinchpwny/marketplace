         <p class = "display-7">Before the advent of computer age, we have been familiar with the use of documentary evidence in court such as contracts, agreements, letters and other writings.</p>
         <p class = "display-7">These writings printed in papers or paper-based documents are popularly known then as our documentary evidence.</p>
         <p class = "display-7">At that time, text message or e-mail message, as it was not yet widely used and known in the Philippines, are not considered as documentary evidence by our courts of law. </p>
